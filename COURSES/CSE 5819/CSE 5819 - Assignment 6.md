## Part 2
### Support Vector Machine
#### a.
We want to find the Lagrangian of the formulation $$\min_{w,b,\xi}\left\{ \frac{1}{2} w^\top w + \frac{C}{2}\sum\xi_{i}^2\right\}$$ subject to $y_{i}(w^\top w + b) \ge 1 - \xi_{i}$ and $i\in \{1,\ldots N\}$.
#### b.
The partial derivative of the Lagrangian from *part a.* with respect to $w$, $b$, and $\xi$ is as follows:
