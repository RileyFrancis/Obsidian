This game is for 2-6 players. To begin the game, shuffle a standard 52 deck of cards, removing both jokers, and deal 8 cards to each player. The rank of cards is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.
### Play
Each round consists of five distinct phases, shown below. After each of the phases below, cards are shuffled together and dealt again until a player reaches 21 points. Once a player reaches 21 points, the game ends and that player is declared the winner. 
##### Trash
Each player discards a card of their choice from their hand face down. Once all players have discarded a card, all players reveal their chosen card. The person with the highest card becomes the jester.
##### Low
Starting to the left of the jester and continuing clockwise, each player chooses and plays a card from their hand into the center. The player with the highest card receives one point.
##### High
Starting to the right of the jester and continuing counterclockwise, each player chooses and plays a card from their hand to the center. The player with the lowest card receives two points.
##### Blackjack
Each player chooses two cards from their hand and places them face up in front of them. Players try to get as close to a score of 21 without going over (called "busting"). Number cards are valued at their numeric value, face cards are worth 10, and aces may be either 1 or 11. 

The jester reveals the top card of the deck, then starting with the player to the left of the jester and continuing clockwise, each player may take one of the following options:
1. Hold: that player does nothing and keeps the cards they played.
2. Hit: that player draws the top card of the deck and adds it to their revealed cards.
3. Double down: that player draws the top card of the deck and adds it to their revealed cards.

After each player has chosen one of the options above, the jester reveals one more card from the top of the deck, then if the sum of the cards is 16 or less, one more card is revealed. The jester then sums the cards revealed from the deck (if aces are revealed, they must be used to get the revealed cards' sum as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it). Players then sum the values of the cards they have, then they receive points based based on their choice earlier:

| Player's outcome                                                         | Hold/Hit | Double Down |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| The player busted                                                        | -        | -2          |
| The player did not score enough to beat the revealed cards from the deck | -        | -1          |
| The player beat the revealed cards from the deck and did not bust        | +2       | +4          |

##### Poker
Starting with the jester and continuing around the table, each player bids a number of points that's fewer than the number of points that they currently have. The jester must bid at least 1. On a player's turn, they may do one of the following:
1. Fold: the player forfeits all points they've bid and are excluded from play for the rest of the round. They discard their cards face down.
2. Call: the player matches the bid of the highest bid so far.
3. Raise: the player bids an amount of points that's larger than the next highest bid so far.

If on a player's turn no other players have raised since their last turn, that player must take one of the following two options:
1. Raise: the player raises their bid by some amount.
2. Check: the player matches the bid of the highest bid so far and reveals the top card of the deck.

Players repeat the process above until two cards have been revealed from the deck. At this point, all players who have not folded reveal the three remaining cards in their hand and determine who wins using the following ranking from worst to best following the table below. Ties within the same tier are broken by the sum of the ranks of the cards.

The player with the best hand wins twice the points that they bid, and all other players lose the points they bid.
