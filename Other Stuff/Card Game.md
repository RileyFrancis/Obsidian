This game is for 2-6 players. To begin the game, shuffle a standard 52 deck of cards, removing both jokers, and deal 8 cards to each player. 
### Play
Each round consists of multiple parts as follows:
##### Trash
Each player discards a card of their choice from their hand face down. Once all players have discarded a card, all players reveal their chosen card. The person with the highest card becomes the jester.
##### Low
Starting to the left of the jester and continuing clockwise, each player chooses and plays a card from their hand into the center.
##### High
Starting to the right of the jester and continuing counterclockwise, each player chooses and plays a card from their hand to the center.
##### Poker
Starting with the jester and continuing around the table, each player bids a number of points that's fewer than the number of points that they currently have. The jester must bid at least 1. On a player's turn, they may do one of the following:
1. Fold: the player forfeits all points they've bid and are excluded from play for the rest of the round. They discard their cards face down.
2. Call: the player matches the bid of the highest bid so far.
3. Raise: the player bids an amount of points that's larger than the next highest bid so far.

If on a player's turn, if no other players have raised since their last turn, that player has the option to reveal the top card of the deck. Players repeat the process above until two cards have been revealed from the deck. At this point, all players who have not folded reveal the three remaining cards in their hand and determine who wins using the following ranking from worst to best:
